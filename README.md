##Description
The application is a task management app known as Taskad, where users can add their daily tasks. This functionality allows them to easily see the tasks they need to fulfill without forgetting. Users can add new tasks by clicking on the 'Add Task' button, which is displayed as a plus icon at the bottom of the screen. They need to provide a task title and description. By default, the task status is 'pending'. Once the task is added, it will be displayed on the home screen along with its title, description, and status. Additionally, there are buttons available to update and delete the task.
To update a task, the user should click the update icon. This allows the user to update the details. If a user has completed a task, they can update its status to 'completed'. To delete a task, the user can click the delete icon. This action will remove the task, and the page will refresh in real-time.
The app also features a splash screen that displays for 4 seconds before navigating to the home screen or the MainActivity.
