    Task Status Management: Users can mark tasks as 'completed' once they have finished them, helping them track their progress and manage their workload effectively.
    Real-time Refresh: Deleting a task triggers a real-time refresh of the page, ensuring that changes are immediately reflected in the app interface.
    Splash Screen: The app features a splash screen that displays for 4 seconds upon launch, providing a smooth transition to the home screen or the MainActivity.
